# Versioning Rules

Always check the following files for version information:

- **Swift Version:** `/.mise.toml`
- **Dependency Versions:** `/Package.swift` & `/Package.resolved`

Always check the following paths for documentation and source code to use as a reference when developing:

- **Core & Standard Libraries:** `/refs/swift/swift/<version>`
- **Dependency Libraries:** `/refs/swift/<package>/<version>`
